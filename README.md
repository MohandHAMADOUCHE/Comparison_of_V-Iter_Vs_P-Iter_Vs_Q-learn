# Comparison of Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, and Q-Learning for Solving Decision-Making Problems

This project focuses on comparing three methods for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in decision-making scenarios: Value Iteration, Policy Iteration (Dynamic Programming methods), and Q-Learning (Temporal-Difference method), implemented in MATLAB.

## Overview

In this project, we explore three major methods for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in decision-making scenarios under uncertainty:

- **Value Iteration**
- **Policy Iteration**
- **Q-Learning**

Each method is tested in different problem settings using MATLAB simulations. The project demonstrates that Policy Iteration is more efficient for complex and irregular scenarios, while a modified version of Q-Learning performs better in simple and regular problems.

We conduct numerical simulations in two environments: a grid-based environment and a mission planning scenario for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). All code is implemented using MATLAB.

## Installation

### Requirements

- MATLAB (any version supporting the base MATLAB functions)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MohandHAMADOUCHE/Comparison_of_V-Iter_Vs_P-Iter_Vs_Q-learn.git
    cd Comparison_of_V-Iter_Vs_P-Iter_Vs_Q-learn
    ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory:
    ```matlab
    cd 'C:\\path\\to\\Comparison_of_V-Iter_Vs_P-Iter_Vs_Q-learn'
    ```

3. Choose the appropriate test based on the case:

   - **3.1. To test the SelectionOptimal_Epsilon-value**: Navigate to the folder `"1_SelectionOptimal_Epsilon-value"` and run the MATLAB file `main.m`:
     ```matlab
     cd '1_SelectionOptimal_Epsilon-value'
     run('main.m')
     ```

   - **3.2. To compare the three methods with a regular case**: Navigate to the folder `"2_GenericRegularGrid"`, choose one of the subfolders corresponding to the different comparison versions, and run the file `main.m`:
     ```matlab
     cd '2_GenericRegularGrid/your-version-folder'
     run('main.m')
     ```

   - **3.3. To compare the three methods with an irregular case**: Navigate to the folder `"3_IrregularGrid"`, choose one of the subfolders corresponding to the different comparison versions, and run the file `main.m`:
     ```matlab
     cd '3_IrregularGrid/your-version-folder'
     run('main.m')
     ```

   - **3.4. To compare the three methods in an experimental UAV mission planning case**: Navigate to the folder `"4_MDP_Mission_Planning"` and run the file `main.m`:
     ```matlab
     cd '4_MDP_Mission_Planning'
     run('main.m')
     ```
